            <p>hello deadusb.github.io fanatics,</p>
            <p>got another blog post for you all here but this ones gonna be real limited in its contents due to the fact that i have been up to nothing in the recent days</p>
            <p>ive been wondering what to do with the new laptop i got.  its running arch linux with kde plasma 5<br>and its nice but there isnt really a reason for me to keep using linux as i go into uni</p>
            <p>ooh talking about uni i actually got my schedule put together nicely since some of the poopy garbage hellish fiends that are the responsible first year students dropped the morning class for calc<br>so that means i got in it</p>
            <p>also coincidentally i got an email mentioning my electives, which apparently i cannot take as a first year<br>so i need 2 new elective courses. ill figure that out ig</p>
            <p>feels weird leaving this off without an image so ill add another cat because those are fucking awesome i love cats</p>
