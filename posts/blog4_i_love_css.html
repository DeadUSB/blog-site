            <p>hey there deadusb.COM loyalists!!!!!!</p>
            <p>and yes you read that right... deadusb.com is now the domain of the site!<br><sup>biggest thanks to <a href="https://github.com/DeadUSB/DeadUSB.github.io/issues/4">karthin</a> for actually buying it</sup></p>
            <p>now that money has actually been poured into this (kinda ass) website, the quality will increase because it feels like a real responsibility yknow?</p>
            <h3>and talking about increasing quality...</h3>
            <p>the site now has vastly better support for mobile<br>but its kinda wip so maybe dont rotate your screen and start lurking<br>or really really shrink the webpage</p>
            <p>besides that weve got more things on the itinerary:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>1.</b> that blog rework i mentioned</li>
                <li><b>2.</b> there's a FOOTER now</li>
                <li><b>3.</b> there's some PADDING now</li>
            </ul>
            <p>lets dive in once again</p>
            <h2><b>1.</b> BLOG REWORK</h2>
            <p>if you read the previous blog post you would know that in topic 3 i mentioned a blog rework, because as of writing this, the blog page is just one after another, which is pretty terrible for a number of reasons.</p>
            <p>i would be working on this now BUT thanks to the new domain i can host this on a subdomain which means <i>blog.deadusb.com</i> will end up hosting the blog posts.</p>
            <p>im told that this would take a seperate repo so in the future the blog site and the normal site might look different due to being standalone sites.</p>
            <p>im very excited for this change so expect something actually good because i really want it to be<br><sup>+ a celebratory cat image</sup></p>

            <img src="../images/blog4_sillycat.jpg" alt="silly cat">

            <p>might make a trello or something for this blog rework cause i have a lot of ideas and i also wanna show off progress</p>

            <h2><b>2.</b> FOOTER</h2>
            <p>scroll to the bottom of the page.  see anything?<br><sup>(you should please tell me you do)</sup></p>
            <p>yeah thats right, a footer for the site<br>im such an innovator aren't i.</p>
            <p>as of writing this blogpost (though i hope not for long) it looks like this:</p>

            <img src="../images/blog4_footer.jpg" alr="hey there">

            <p>ill eventually add something like a contact link or whatever websites usually have down there<br><sup>maybe a webring?</sup></p>
            <p>this might not actually stay tbh.  not sure how i feel abt a footer for the site</p>

            <h2><b>3.</b> PADDING</h2>

            <p>bit of a 2-in-1 here but the site looked kinda stupid panning across the whole device<br>and with a little css and troubleshooting, it looks a LOT better now.</p>
            <p>by "2-in-1", i am referring to how blogposts are now aligned to the LEFT of the box, which makes everthing look more readable and more professional<br><sub>which is ironic considering this site is far from professional</sub></p>

            <h2><b>BONUS:</b> I FORGOT THIS IN THE LAST POST</h2>

            <p>while writing the previous post, mega joined vc and i wanted to include him BUT I FORGOT TO PUT IN THE <i>&lt;img&gt;</i> TAG BUT I STILL PUT THE IMAGE IN THE FOLDER SO THERE WAS AN IMAGE LABELLED <i>blog3_himega.jpg</i> AND I PUSHED IT WITHOUT USING IT SO I LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT.</p>
            <p>anyways, after a simple rename the image is now being used in THIS post.<br>(because apart from spelling mistakes and continuity, i am NOT going to tamper with old posts)</p>

            <img src="../images/blog4_himega.jpg" alt="me and mega in a discord voice channel named 'karaoke'">

            <h3>anyways that pretty much wraps it up for this post, thanks for reading.</h3>
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">big things coming soon.<br>love you all</h2>
