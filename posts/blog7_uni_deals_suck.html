            <h1>Uni Deals Suck</h1>
            <h3>published August 12, 2023</h3>
            <p>hello there deadusb.com dwellers,</p>

            <p>i have not been up to much, thanks for asking.  but i have been up to preparing for uni<br>which is very exciting</p>
            <p>you can thank that for the lack of stuff</p>
            <p>i really cant leave my amazing loyalists waiting so long without a post. <sub>(thats a lie, im bored and its like 7am)</sub></p>
            <p>anyways while looking around for uni supplies i ended up finding some deals that students get<br>spoiler alert they're all kinda garbage</p>

            <p>first up, we have apple:</p>

            <img src="../images/blog7_appleUnidays.png" alt="$200 gift card on select ipads and macs">

            <p>sounds like a good deal right?<br>kinda</p>
            <p>tbh a $200 gift card to apple is like a couple of free accessories which usually look kinda weird but are rather well in quality.</p>
            <p>fun fact this is the only deal i actually took cause i could really use an ipad for notetaking and math problems<br>thank you mother for funding this purchase <sub>(i am so god damn broke)</sub></p>
            <p>overall its an ok deal, the ipad itself is barely on sale but the fact that i needed an apple pencil anyways (which the gift card covers) is very nice</p>

            <p>next up is<br>uh this:</p>

            <img src="../images/blog7_adam&eveUnidays.png" alt="50% off + one free item at Adam&Eve">

            <p>this one<br>yeah idk</p>
            <p>my favourite part about uni is all the dildos and sextoys i need to buy so it really helps to get some %50 off</p>
            <p>idrc that this one exists its just that this is somehow one of the better deals on the site<br>moving on</p>

            <p>now we got Razer:</p>

            <img src="../images/blog7_razerUnidays.png" alt="various deals from Razer">

            <p>what is RazerCare that sounds so dumb</p>
            <p>+ why is there a deal for laptops and then a joke for laptops</p>
            <p>truly anyone buying something razer for post-secondary purposes deserves to fail every course<br>no hate to razer specifically, i use some products but not for anything professional lmao</p>
            <p>gonna show up to class with my rgb light show i saved 5% on</p>
            <p>[insert linus tech tip segway]</p>

            <img src="../images/blog7_nordvpnUnidays.png" alt="its nord vpn you already know the deal">

            <p>NordVPN!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
            <p>why is this even here<br>its insulting</p>
            <p>ive seen this exact same deal on half of the youtube videos i watch</p>
            <p>recycling it here for uni/college students is seriously so pointless</p>

            <p>whatever i've had enough of these deals<br>if you want to laugh at them yourself just go to myunidays.com or whatever<br><sub>not even worth my time to put an <i>&lt;a&gt;</i></sub></p>

            <p>sorry for the filler but the bad news is the posts will be more scarce<br>hope you understand</p>

            <h2 style="text-align: center;">thanks for reading. love you all</h2>
