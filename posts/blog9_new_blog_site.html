            <p>hello my lovely BLOG.deadusb.com squires</p>
            <p>and yes you read that right... blog.deadusb.com is now the domain of the BLOG!<br><sup>biggest thanks to <a href="https://github.com/DeadUSB/DeadUSB.github.io/issues/4">karthin</a> for actually buying it</sup></p>

            <p>a big visual change huh? i've finally split up all the posts into seperate pages so it isnt just one huge line of posts</p>
            <p>you'll also notice theres actually been 2 blog posts with this update; <a href="./blog8_sppongy_is_dumb">this one</a> specifically.</p>

            <p>its not actually important im just making fun of <a href="https://sppongy.com">sppongy</a></p>

            <p>besides that im sorry for taking so long with this new site, there really isnt an excuse other than wanting to use a static site generator to make the process easier<br>which then made me realize that i wanted to make something myself, which led into impulse deciding to make one myself.</p>
            <p>though im not all too sure if i'll actually complete it.  i'd like to but i know myself and i likely wont.</p>
            <p>cant stop me from talking about it tho</p>

            <h2>Brass: a blog maintainer static site generater whatever written in Rust:</h2>

            <p>named it Brass and im working on it in Rust.  no real reason for any of those, its just what i went with.</p>

            <p>basically my plan for it is to translate a markdown file into a blogpost and does all the html for me because i've been writing it all by hand and its getting really tedious but also its still fun cause i like doing it myself.  I could use an existing one but thats so much work and even though this is more work whatever I Dont Care!!!!!!</p>
        
            <p>ok thats enough this blog has been essentially done for like a week now and ive just been doing nothing so its time to PUSH!!!!</p>

            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Thank you for reading and waiting.  its ok because i love you all</h2>
