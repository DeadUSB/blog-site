            <p>HI HELLO HOW ARE YOU DEADUSB.COM DARLINGS</p>
            <p>i am so not on top of things rn BUT this blog post is for mega because ONCE AGAIN I FORGOT HIM<br>how could i</p>

            <audio controls>
                <source src="../sounds/dead_usb_gamer_music.wav" type="audio/wav">
                dude's got an outdated browser
                missing out on the mega music smh
            </audio>

            <p>fun fact: i was making a game in unity called USB and i asked mega to make some music for like a main menu<br>while i didnt finish that game mega did end up making some really cool ambience and its nice to see im still using it in some way on this website</p>

            <p>also thanks to mr Pdot suggesting what to add to the site, i have added my <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/deadusb/">steam</a>.</p>

            <p>i'd say go add me but honestly i probably wont accept. <sub>(but do check out <a href="http://devilmayquake.com">this</a> on steam instead.)</sub></p>

            <p>self note here but i should make the links on mobile icons instead so it doesnt get so crouded at the top <sub>credit to karthin for this idea (it was mine but like he said it out loud first)</sub></p>

            <h2 style="text-align: center;">anyways THANKS FOR READING, LOVE YOU ALL, ESPECIALLY MEGA</h2>
