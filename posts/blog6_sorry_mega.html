                missing out on the mega music smh
            </audio>

            <p>fun fact: i was making a game in unity called USB and i asked mega to make some music for like a main menu<br>while i didnt finish that game mega did end up making some really cool ambience and its nice to see im still using it in some way on this website</p>

            <p>also thanks to mr Pdot suggesting what to add to the site, i have added my <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/deadusb/">steam</a>.</p>

            <p>i'd say go add me but honestly i probably wont accept. <sub>(but do check out <a href="http://devilmayquake.com">this</a> on steam instead.)</sub></p>

            <p>self note here but i should make the links on mobile icons instead so it doesnt get so crouded at the top <sub>credit to karthin for this idea (it was mine but like he said it out loud first)</sub></p>
