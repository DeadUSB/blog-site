            <h1>Improving the Website<br><sup>(working title: FOUND SOMETHING TO DO)</sup></h1>
            <h3><sub>(also)</sub> published August 3, 2023</h3>
            <p>hello deadusb.github.io henchmen, got a BIG post for you all to make up for the lull that was the previous post</p>
            <p>got a few things on the to-do list already which is ironic considering the last blog post talking about how bored i am was like 2 minutes ago</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>1.</b> we are gonna add EMBEDS!!!</li>
                <li><b>2.</b> removing the '.html'</li>
                <li><b>3.</b> reorganizing the blog <sub>(soon)</sub></li>
                <li><b>4.</b> new breakout game <sub>(for a later date)</sub></li>
                <li><b>5.</b> comments <sub>(for a way way later date (i hope))</sub></li>
            </ul>
            <p>lets go over what this entails<br><sup>(like a real blog post!)</sup></p>
            <h2><b>1.</b> EMBEDS</h2>
            <p>you ever been using discord and paste a link and something appears at the bottom????<br>example:</p>

            <img src="../images/blog3_googleEmbed.jpg" alt="google.com's embed on discord">

            <p>yeah well this amazing site is MISSING those<br>which is lame</p>

            <img src="../images/blog3_noEmbed.jpg" alt="deadusb.github.io with NO embed (lame)">

            <p>i decided i wanted one of those<br>but what should i put on it?</p>
            <p>to figure out what exactly i wanted to do with the rich embed i came up with a few ideas and presented them like this:</p>

            <img src="../images/blog3_ideas.jpg" alt="1.latest blog? 2.simple introduction? 3.zoos music? 4.annoy sppongy?">

            <p>took some darts and bought a new monitor which led me to realize; why not all of them?<sub> (sorta)</sub></p>
            <p>you might be saying "but awesome cool mr dadusb? what do you mean all of them?<br>and to that i say <i>Feast Your Eyes</i> on my CONCEPT DRAWINGS!</p>

            <img src="../images/blog3_conceptBlog.png" width="400" height="300"> <img src="../images/blog3_conceptIndex.png" width="400" height="300">

            <p>we will have TWO embeds!  one for the blog specifically, and another for the rest of the site.  <sub>note the blog one was supposed to have the subtext.. my bad</sub></p>
            <p>alr going in-depth here the blog one will always have the latest post, unless the link is to a specific blog (spoilers for topic 3), and at the bottom, a reminder to sppongy that he cant get a blog up (like the loser pants he is)</p>
            <p>the normal one, the index, will have a basic introduction, alongside zoos music as a video or something</p>

            <h3>turns out my vision was too great for discord to handle</h3>

            <p>jk but seems a bit of a problem has come up<br>turns out discord has exclusive stuff with youtube and such for the embeds (which makes sense tbh)</p>
            <p>but that means no zoosmusic video/audio playing.  which sucks but instead i talked to mr zoosmusic HIMSELF and added this amazing gif per his request</p>

            <img src="../images/blog3_sillycat.gif" alt="silly cat swimming">

            <p>anyways ill touch up on this more but so far things are going well.<br>now onto part 2</p>

            <h2><b>2.</b> REMOVING .HTML</h2>

            <p>this was actually very easy, thanks to this great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLbYIwrB1Hs">video</a></p>
            <p>tbh a little too easy i wonder if this is bad practice</p>

            <h2><b>3.</b> REORGANIZING THE BLOG</h2>

            <p>ok this is first update that'll come later but basically,<br>imagine a blog that ENDLESSLY SCROLLS.</p>
            <p>a pretty annoying thing to imagine no?  yeah i thought so too.<br>so basically im going to shrink all the other blog posts and leave the latest one open<br>like this</p>
            <img src="../images/blog3_conceptNewBlog.png" alt="the deadusb website with smaller blog posts">

            <p>this is really simple so expect this update soon my loves.</p>

            <h2><b>4.</b> NEW BREAKOUT GAME</h2>

            <p>ok moving onto the rest of the site since this blog has been hogging up most of the site anyways</p>
            <p>one of the very first coding programming things i did was make the shit little breakout game thats been featured on every iteration of this site</p>
            <p>and if you played it you'd agree.<br>doesnt even matter cause i "stole"<sub>(rewrote)</sub> that from some tutorial article that i was learning from</p>
            <p>in short; it wasnt mine, and i want to feature amazing ORIGINAL content<br><sup>and thanks to the power of Unity2D i can!</sup></p>

            <img src="../images/blog3_breakout.jpg" max-width="1280" height=auto alt="Unity2D with my amazing breakout game in progress">

            <p>truly amazing no?  its been on hold for 2 weeks already but since im making this post and im not one to dissapoint <sub>(often)</sub> ill get it finished up and on this site PostHaste</p>

            <h2><b>5.</b> COMMENTS</h2>

            <p>remember how i said im not one to dissapoint?  you should expect that from this topic.</p>
            <p>i really really want to do this but theres a chance i am incapable of making something like this cause it requires things such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a backend</li>
                <li>a user system</li>
                <li>this is mostly off the top of my head but this is already a lot ok</li>
            </ul>
            <p>yeah this will come in quite a later time because i need js and maybe php (idk what php is for) + some other stuff idk</p>
            <p>yeah um thats finally it.  gonna be back in about a week or so for that blog rework<br>time to push this commit and hope everything works</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">THANK YOU ALL FOR READING // LOVE YOU ALL</h2>
