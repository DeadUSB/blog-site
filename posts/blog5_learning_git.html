            <h1>Learning Git + Feedback</h1>
            <h3>published August 7, 2023</h3>
            <p>hello once again deadusb.com lackeys</p>
            <p>i got another blog post for you all<br>one may wonder how i pump these out in such quick succession, and to that i suggest you ask your mother this question.</p>
            <p>anyways this post is going to be more just me talking about stuff instead of the technicality of the site.</p>
            <p>ok another quick overview of this post:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>1.</b> Learning Git Properly</li>
                <li><b>2.</b> Feedback on The Site</li>
                <li><b>3.</b> Readressing Claims</li>
            </ul>
            <p>short topics for now but hey, they cant all be winners.</p>
            <h2><b>1.</b> LEARNING GIT</h2>
            <h3>im sorry.</h3>
            <p>for not running <a href="https://github.com/DeadUSB/DeadUSB.github.io/commit/de3d2097ec63cc77b0c390eefab1f1bc45612164"><i>git pull --rebase</i></a>.</p>
            <p>when adding the domain and earlier that day, i had pushed commits to the repository which were small enough changes that i had completely forgotten about.</p>
            <p>which is a terrible excuse overall, i should run <i>git pull</i> whenever i need to work on this in the first place.</p>
            <p>after constant reminders and ridicule, <sub>(aka, like 3 messages and some actually helpful suggestions)</sub><br>i cracked open the amazing <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Git Book</a>.</p>
            <p>which really cleared things up to be honest. git is really cool<br>from now on i will make sure to use git responsibly, thank you karthin.</p>

            <h2><b>2.</b> FEEDBACK</h2>

            <p>apparently you guys arent so keen on the black bars the site has on pc.</p>
            <img src="../images/blog5_currentSite.jpg" alt="deadusb.com homepage">
            <p>tbh i like them but i do admit they're rather bland.<br>if i can find something cool to replace them with then ofc ill go for it but for now the site's gonna stay like this.</p>
            <p>if u have any opinions just dm me on discord</p>

            <h2><b>3.</b> READRESSING CLAIMS</h2>

            <p>so going back on these old posts i just want to completely verify whats going on with the site, like a little roadmap</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>1.</b> breakout game</li>
                <li><b>2.</b> blog rework</li>
                <li><b>3.</b> extras</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>BREAKOUT GAME</h3>

            <p>yeah tbh if im going to make a whole game for this site i'd rather broaden my horizons than just remaster a pretty garbage game already on here</p>
            <p>so maybe ill make a different game but tbh that requires me finishing a project and waayyyy to lazy to do that<br>any ideas lmk</p>

            <h3>BLOG REWORKS</h3>

            <p>i feel like i just kinda glossed over this in the previous post but the blog rework is going to take some time to actually come out since theres quite a bit of things to be adding/considering</p>
            <p>this is the one thing i'll guarantee though since blog posts are the only active work being done on this site</p>

            <h3>EXTRAS</h3>

            <p>that footer, i really dont know what to do with it</p>
            <p>sppongy and karthin you mfs need to get a good site up ffs</p>

            <p>whatever, i've delayed this post long enough and honestly i didnt even do anything this time<br>next one will come with actual changes i promise</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">thanks for reading. love, deadusb</h2>
